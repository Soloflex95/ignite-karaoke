# Ignite Karaoke

To get started, just clone this repository and then open `karaoke.html`
in your browser. Have fun!

If you want to add photos, just add their URLs to the `local_images`
variable in `karaoke.js`!

## What is it?

Ignite talks are a special talk format: 5 minute talks consisting of
20 slides which _auto advance_ every 15 seconds. It's a really neat talk
format.

In Ignite Karaoke, the slides auto advance, but there are only 5
slides per talk, except you have no idea what your slides will look
like! It leads to some pretty funny improv.

I first saw Ignite Karaoke at a Velocity conference. For an example, see:
